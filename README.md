# Government digital service design principles poster
Posters in support of the GDS design principles.
These are supposed to stay as close to the principles on GOV.UK as possible. It didnt make sence to reproduce some on the content on the page because it links off to a photo of the original [7 principles](https://www.flickr.com/photos/benterrett/7041509709/).

## Contributing
If there are typos and mistakes raise an issue and I'll fix them when I can. Or, put in a pull request for the change. 
The posters are artwoked in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).

## Printing
These are intended to be printed at A0 they will _probably_ work at other sizes.
